# read-tdd
- Read Test-Driven Development By Example written by Kent Beck
- This repository is for summary and actual test-writing of his messages. 
- Many part of this book is written in Java, but for our own situation, we'll use Python for exercise

## Requirements
- Good to have your own virtual environment
    - there are tons of libraries for this for Python
    - but in my case I prefer [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) for its easy usability

- Clone this repo, but you don't need to install any extra library
    - as you can see, we'll use [Unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html) since it is what Django uses
    - however, as we read through the chapters of the book, this requirements above might change

## Use Unittest Library
- TBA

## Takeaways

### Again, the cycle
- first, write the story in the form of a test
- second, make it work in any ways - sins are allowed
- finally, repent your sin via refactoring

### Change the test
- if you want a change in the functionality or the interface, you need to change the test

### Test Strategy
- fake implmentation: return a constant, and gradually replace it with variables until you have the real code
- write the real code first, if you are obvious in what you're doing

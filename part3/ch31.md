# Ch31. Refactoring
- Refactoring: change the code in a way not affecting the result of passing the tests

## Reconcile Diffs
- Gradually make two codes similar with each other, eventually the same
- Big jump is recommended to be avoided
    
- Some tips:
    - Merge two loop structures
    - Eliminate conditionals
    - merge two similar methods and classes

## Isolate Change
- Isolate the part that needs to be changed

## Techniques

### Migrate Data
- Temporarily duplicate the data:
    - introduce the new format
    - replace the old one with the new one
    - delete the old one

### Extract Method
- Turn a long and complicated method easier to read
    - Make a small part of it into a separate method, and call it
    - Typical ones: loops, conditions

### Inline Method
- Simplifying control flows having become too twisted or scattered
    - Replace a method invocation with the method itself

### Extract Interface
- Create an interface containing the shared operations

### Move Method
- Move a method to the class it belongs to, and then invoke it

### Method Object
- Too complicated method(many params, local vars) => make an object!
    - Good for adding a whole new kind of logic to the system
    - You can do its own tests as well
    - Also good for simplifying the code, which Extract Method cannot do

### Add Parameter
- Add parameters to the interface of a class first
- A part of data migration as well

### Method Parameter to Constructor Parameter
- Why? For DRY(duplicated params among the methods)
- The opposite direction: contructor => method is also possible if there is only one method

# Ch29. xUnit Patterns

## Assertion
- Write a boolean expression so that you automate your judgement
    - A judgement becomes an evaluation in computation

- But be specific, not a mere `assertTrue`
    - Compare specific values like dates, not mere booleans or `null`s

- If you find difficulties in testing an object, it is not the problem of the test,  
but it is the design of the object that matters

## Fixture
- What about common objects? 
    - Override `setup` method and init those objects as instance variables
    - DRY

- But sometimes too complex setups are somewhat troublesome
    - Slow runtime
    - Hard to make variations in individual tests

## External Fixture
- Release external resources: override `teardown()`
    - Even if the same object is used for several tests, each test has exactly  
    the same object's state

- Make a logic of release in a single test is not a good idea
    - Duplication
    - Error-prone
    - Not relevant t othe test itself

## Test Method
- Tests are written as methods(classes: fixture)
- The name should be easy to understand, indicating the purpose of its test
    - If it is too long, try writing smaller tests

## Exception Test
- Catch expected exceptions(thrown deliberately) and ignore them
- The test is broken only if wrong kinds of exceptions are raised

## All Tests
- Make a suite of suites of tests
- Not like when this book was written, these days you wouldn't need to worry about this

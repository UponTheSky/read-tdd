# Ch28. Green Bar Patterns

## Fake It('Til You Make It)
- When you're stuck in a moment
    1. Return a constant
    2. Gradually convert this constant into an expression using variables

- Having running sth is better than nothing
    - Refactoring begins
    - Scope control: we have solved an immediate problem so we can go on to the next steps

## Triangulate
- Give two or more examples if you're not certain about abstraction
- Kent Beck says that it gives an infinite loop of simplifying the implementation -> does it?

## Obvious Implementation
- If you're sure of what you're doing, go straight to the implementation
- But this requires perfection of yourself... 
    - Making it running & clean at the same time?
    - Don't be afraid of going down - Fake it, and Triangulate

## One to Many
- working with a collection of objects?
    - Add one by one, but keep the test running as it is
    - An example of Isolate Change(change the code, so that we can   
    change the test code without affecting the code)

# Ch27. Testing Patterns

## Child Test
- Keep the tests small
- Subdivide a big chunk

## Mock Objects
- Testing an object that relies on an expensive and complicated resource
- Mock object is useful: performance(fast), reliable(no error), and readability(easy to understand)
- Be careful of a global object

## Self Shunt
- An object communicating with other objects
    - Why not communicating with a test case itself?
    - But is it a good idea?(since this mechanism depends on a testing framework)

- I think what Kent Beck thinks is that it urges us to implement simple interface classes/objects for testing

## Log String
- How to check a sequence of message callings?
    - Keep a log in a string and append to the string when a message is called
    - Useful when implementing Observer

## Crash Test Dummy
- Testing error code?: deliberately throw an error anyways!
    - error code is also code

## Broken Test
- When you're working alone, leave a test broken helps you catching up your current work  
in the next day

## Clean Check-in
- But working as a team, make sure tests are running okay. 
- It is surely not easy - you'll always find a broken case in the integration testing
    - start over, and deepen your knowledge about the code

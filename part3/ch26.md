# Ch26. Red Bar Patterns

## One Step Test
1. Make a list of simple tests that you think necessary
2. Pick and implement one by one, but this should be something that:
    - will teach you sth new
    - you are confident to implement
3. Repeat the process

- Known-to-unknown
    - The past tests are firm stepping stone
    - From those we can discover the unknown

## Starter Test
- Start by testing a variant of an operation that doesn't do anything

- Why not from a realistic test?
    - Often it is hard to implement
    - You need to have loops with a short interval

- Starter test
    - Output == input
    - The input must be as small as possible

- Pick a starter test that teaches you something & you can quickly get to work

## Explanation Test
- Ask for and give explanation in terms of tests: communicate via tests

## Learning Test
- Learn an external product via testing

## Another Test
- When you have a (seemingly)brilliant idea, add a test to the list and go back to the topic

## Regression Test
- When a defect is reported, run a test that fails, then you fix it
- Regression test?: a test that is added as if it should have been written before
    - Think about how you would have written it in the first placd

- What are good points of Regression test?
    - A way to see the whole application
    - Suggests that you need to improve your way of writing tests

## Break
- Take a break!

## Do Over
- When something goes not well, think about starting over

## Cheap Desk, Nice Chair
- Your working environment is important for your performance
